He saw himself in her eyes, suspended in two shining drops of bright water, himself 
dark and tiny, in fine detail, the lines about his mouth, everything there, as if her eyes 
were two miraculous bits of violet amber that might capture and hold him intact. Her 
face, turned to him now, was fragile milk crystal with a soft and constant light in it. It 
was not the hysterical light of electricity but-what? But the strangely comfortable and 
rare and gently flattering light of the candle. One time, when he was a child, in a 
power-failure, his mother had found and lit a last candle and there had been a brief 
hour of rediscovery, of such illumination that space lost its vast dimensions and drew 
comfortably around them, and they, mother and son, alone, transformed, hoping that 
the power might not come on again too soon 

It was a special pleasure to see things eaten, to see things blackened and changed. 
With the brass nozzle in his fists, with this great python spitting its venomous 
kerosene upon the world, the blood pounded in his head, and his hands were the hands
 of some amazing conductor playing all the symphonies of blazing and burning to 
bring down the tatters and charcoal ruins of history. With his symbolic helmet 
numbered 451 on his stolid head, and his eyes all orange flame with the thought of 
what came next, he flicked the igniter and the house jumped up in a gorging fire that 
burned the evening sky red and yellow and black. He strode in a swarm of fireflies. 
He wanted above all, like the old joke, to shove a marshmallow on a stick in the 
furnace, while the flapping pigeon-winged books died on the porch and lawn of the 
house. While the books went up in sparkling whirls and blew away on a wind turned 
dark with burning.
